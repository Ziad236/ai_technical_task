# üß† Python Code Generator with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B

This project provides a web-based interface for generating Python code snippets using the `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B` model. It allows users to input tasks in natural language and receive clean, executable Python code ‚Äî without any explanation or extra formatting.

Built using:
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app) for the web UI
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) for loading and using the LLM
- Python regex for extracting code blocks
